#  Medical Image Classification using Deep Learning

This repository presents two deep learning projects focused on the classification of medical images using public datasets: **RetinaMNIST** and **ChestMNIST**. These projects explore different disease detection tasks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), data augmentation, and performance evaluation techniques.

# Projects

### 1.  RetinaMNIST – Retinal Disease Classification

**Objective:** Classify retinal OCT images into 5 categories using a grayscale image dataset.

**Highlights:**
- Custom CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Data augmentation to address class imbalance
- Training, validation, and testing workflow
- Accuracy/loss curves and confusion matrix analysis

### 2. ChestMNIST – Chest X-ray Image Classification

**Objective:** Classify chest X-ray images into one dominant diagnostic category (single-label multi-class adaptation of a multi-label dataset).

**Highlights:**
- Label simplification to convert multi-label to single-label classification
- Custom CNN model
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and F1-score
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization of class distributions
